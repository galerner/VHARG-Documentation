Running Energy Cone models via the ECMapProb Code

Introduction

The ECMapProb code (Aravena et al. 2020) is run in a terminal window in python, and has two versions: Friendly_ECMapProb.py and ECMapProb.py. When the friendly file is run in python, it opens an intuitive GUI with self-explanatory fields for inputs and steps for unning the program. However, it is much more efficient to run many energy cone models consecutively or concurrently by running the ECMapProb.py in the terminal.

All files necessary to run the code can be downloaded from the GitHub of Alvaro Aravena here: https://github.com/AlvaroAravena/ECMapProb

The code runs in python3 and requires the following modules: matplotlib, numpy, elevation, Pillow, utm, and tifffile. Some of the modules are difficult to install in the current version of python3, all work well in the Anaconda environment.
